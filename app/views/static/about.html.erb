  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Hello there! Welcome to Poke Tracker, a way to aggregate data from the Pokemon Go world for players. We thought it'd be cool if we could get players together to share their experience and knowledge to help educate everyone and inform everyone. While there is no easy way to get all the information about all the different gyms, pokestops, and spawns in Pokemon Go, we think that with everyone's help we can create this project.
  <p>We are currently just two dudes looking to bring everyone together for a common cause. We will be continually upgrading and changing things so feel free to leave us a message or contact us if you run into any issues or if you just want to let us know how you feel. Please be courteous to your other Pokemon Go players and work together! Happy hunting!</p>
  <h3>Why do this?</h3>
  <p>Why not? We're having fun playing this game and we enjoy going out, driving around, and collecting pokestops. We already have some optimized routes we take. We just think it'd be really cool to come together to make better informed decisions and try new routes.</p>
  <p>Eventually we want to supply an API where people can access the data. We want people to see where there are a lot of spawns for a Pokemon they are trying to catch and go there.</p>
  <h4>Legal Stuff, I think?</h4>
  <p>We are in no way affiliated with Niantic Inc., Pokemon Co., Nintendo Co., GameFreaks, etc. We do not know the developers of this game. We are just normal players trying to have fun. Please don't sue us!</p>
